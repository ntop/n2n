.TH supernode 1  "Jul 16, 2021" "version 3" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
supernode \- n2n supernode daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B supernode
<config file>
.br
.B supernode
[OPTION]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
N2N is a peer-to-peer VPN system. Supernode is a node introduction registry,
broadcast conduit and packet relay node for the n2n system. On startup supernode
begins listening on the specified UDP port for node registrations, and other
packets to route. The supernode can service any number of communities and routes
packets only between members of the same community. The supernode does not hold
the community encryption key and so cannot snoop or inject packets into the
community.
.PP
Supernode can service a number of n2n communities concurrently. Traffic does not
cross between communities.
.PP
All logging goes to stdout.
.PP
The config file is similar to the command line, with one option per line.
Lines starting with a "#" are ignored.
An equal sign ('=') should be used between key and value. Example: -p=7777
